  <P><P ALIGN=CENTER><FONT COLOR="#DDA0DD"><FONT FACE="Verdana"><FONT SIZE="4">The photos you sent me that I love... and why I love them...</P></FONT COLOR></FONT></FONT></P>
 
  <P><img src="./src/img/1.jpeg"width="300px" height="300px"><img src="./src/img/2.jpeg"width="398px" height="300px" ALIGN="top"><img src="./src/img/3.jpeg" width="332px" height="300px"><img src="./src/img/4.jpeg"width="300px" height="300px" ALIGN="right"></P>
  <p>The first image was the first photo you sent me... it was at your family's christening... that's why I love this photo... there's a context<BR>
     The second photo was when I found out that you have a house on the lake... this always reminds me of all the movies and series I watched on netflix<BR>
     The tree picture. I like this photo... because you sent it to me and it gives me an idea of what it's like to be on a plane.. probably when I go there it will be the first time I get on a plane<BR>
     I love the fourth one because snow seems to be something incredible... you made snow even more incredible for me by saying many things about it.. including the absurdity.. that you eat snow!!</p>
  <P><img src="./src/img/5.jpeg"width="300px" height="300px"><img src="./src/img/6.jpeg"width="398px" height="300px" ALIGN="top"><img src="./src/img/7.jpeg" width="332px" height="300px"><img src="./src/img/8.jpeg"width="300px" height="300px" ALIGN="right"></P>
  <P>The first photo made me realize how similar we are... it was in this photo that I commented that I liked to imagine what the person was thinking at the moment... you said that you had said the same thing to your friends..<BR>
     The second one makes you even more special... it was on your baptism day and in our generation that's pretty amazing.<BR>
     The tree, was at a prom... I like this photo because his brother looks like a bad boy... like in movies that show teenagers at school.. his brother would be the bully, but he's kind and sweet inside<BR>
     The fourth makes you a little less like me... you love cats... and I literally have allergies...</P>
     <P><img src="./src/img/9.jpeg"width="300px" height="300px"><img src="./src/img/10.jpeg"width="398px" height="300px" ALIGN="top"><img src="./src/img/11.jpeg" width="332px" height="300px"><img src="./src/img/12.jpeg"width="300px" height="300px" ALIGN="right"></P>
     <P>I'm going to talk generally about these pictures from when you were in Virginia Beach... These are my FAVORITE pictures! They make me feel something so special.. I can imagine watching that sunset.. and walking on the soft, snow-white sand... But for me, the last one is my favorite.. She makes me feel super special. ! It will be the background of my cell phone.. Through it I can feel as if there was a piece of me there.. even being far away, it makes me feel close.</P>
     <P><img src="./src/img/13.jpeg"width="300px" height="300px"><img src="./src/img/14.jpeg"width="300px" height="300px" ALIGN="right"><video controls><source src="./src/video/15.1.mp4" type="video/mp4" ALIGN="top"/><video controls><source src="./16.1.mp4" type="video/mp4"/></P> 
     <p>I loved the first picture because I love dogs too and your liking dogs and cats shows a little bit of who you are... people who like dogs can't even be considered normal people. are angels<BR>
      I just love this video.. that was the day I found out that you have an angelic voice..<BR>
        The third would be the video of you inviting me to live there... well, at least it was the attempt ksksks, I tried to put it here because who knows in the future you'll be fluent in Portuguese and you'll be able to laugh a little about it<BR>
        The fourth was the day I found out that your eyes are as blue as the sky.. This is so amazing</p>

          <P><P ALIGN=CENTER><FONT COLOR="#DDA0DD"><FONT FACE="Verdana"><FONT SIZE="4">When you're having a sad day</FONT COLOR></FONT></FONT></FONT></P></P>

     <p>Then I'll try to put my messege voice or videos in Portuguese... but you'll have to promise me that you'll only listen when you're sad!, later I will show you a way to listen or translate voice messages and videos in real time<BR>
      For now, I'm going to leave here two phrases that I always say</p>

      <P>"Tomorrow could be the best day of your life!!"<BR>
        "Nothing is bad enough that it can't get worse." ksksk</P>

      <p>And I also like to think that if God allowed you to be alive today, it's because he still has something for you.</p>
